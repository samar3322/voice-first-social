## Overview

This lightweight, offline-capable app prioritizes authentic, voice-led communication. Users can capture their thoughts, ideas, or messages as voice recordings, apply various fun or privacy-friendly voice effects, and share them to a community feed visible locally on their device.

Unlike traditional social networks, this app has no text posts, no images, no tracking, and no backend infrastructure. All data is stored securely in the user's browser, emphasizing privacy and simplicity.
